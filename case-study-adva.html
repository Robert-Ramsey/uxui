                    <h2>Telecom Equipment Product Line</h2>
                    <p>ADVA Optical Networking, a global manufacturer of telecommunications equipment was receiving critical feedback from it's customer base.<strong> Purchasing decisions by top Network Engineers at major clients like Microsoft, Verizon and Deutche Telecom were being impacted by multiple user issues across several telecommunications products.</strong> Difficulty finding functions, completing tasks and understanding the status of equipment were frustrating many users. Using multiple ADVA products was forcing the engineers to repeatedly relearn basic functions. The issues were causing concern about brand credibility on the floor of major Network Operating Centers. As the top UX professional in the company, I was asked to contribute to solutions and lead the creation of a new front-end specification.</p>

                <h2>Design Planning </h2><br/>
                <p>I first started researching the Telecommunications Industry and the many challenges faced by those who set up network devices and get the equipment talking to each other. Through discovery my team and I then<strong> mapped the entire customer journey to locate pain points. We found that a Network Engineer could perform dozens of critical tasks while recieving, installing, commissioning, provisioning, monitoring, adminstrating, troubleshooting and maintaining </strong>fiber optics equipment. Finding a piece of equipment in a network, understanding it's current status, viewing and changing its configuration details were critical skills, as well as finding an troubleshooting problems, and setting up new hardware.</p>
                <p>To bring about incremental improvements, my UX Researcher and I completed multiple types of user research and testing. We designed and tested solutions to <strong>enhance recall and recognizability, reduce visual complexity, simplify repetitive actions and bring continuity to the build process as well as the brand and 15+ product interfaces</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Industry and Competitive Product Research </h2>
            <p>Telecom interfaces are constrained by several regulatory bodies, most importantly the <strong>Telecordia and ITU Telecom regulations and standards</strong>, which go back over thirty years for legacy telecom systems. Making matters more complex, technical standards that are not specified, have developed in a multitude of ways across industry leaders like <strong>Juniper, Cisco, Cyan, Infinera, Splunk, OpManager</strong>. A study of these competitors revealed multiple opportunities as well as a fundamental software pattern known as <strong>FCAPS (Fault, Configuration, Administrate, Performance, Security)</strong> that helped guide our thinking.</p>

                <figcaption class="figure-caption">Multiple Interfaces across ADVA Product Line</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>I performed <strong>heuristic walkthroughs</strong> and noted consistencies and trouble spots across advas product line. The product interfaces spanned several business units and value streams and controlled equipment, known as telecom nodes, like optical transmitters, recievers, splitters, amplifyers and timing devices. To tap deep intellectual resources,<strong> we discussed each product with people from the marketing, engineering, customer service, training, and content departments</strong>some of whom have had their jobs for decades.</p>
            <p>Next I performed a basic <strong>Competitive Analysis</strong>, looking at competing product interfaces in the same basic category. I found multiple good examples and was able to assess where we may pick up ideas or improve in areas our competitors were lacking</p>

            <h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>
            <p>During a cold December week, my colleage and I travelled to an actual project in the field to to an <strong>ethnographic field study</strong>y. A four node fiber optics ring was to be set up in Kimball, North  Dakota connecting to White Plains and Platte. There we travelled to nearby worksites with the installing team to watch them install and bring up several fiber optics nodes, get them communicaing in a ring and test the purity of the optical signals.</p>
            <p>Using multiple tools and pieces of equipment in the fiber node, they installed the equipment while we perfomed a four day field study that inlcuded:<strong>observations, interviews, and task analysis</strong>. The slideshow below documents some of the on site activities.</p>

                  <h2>Personas</h2>
            <p>Our research uncovered a great deal of information regarding the needs of our subjects. Our data allowed us to describe <strong>5 distinct job roles using the ADVA software products</strong>. In some of the larger Network Operating Centers these were found to be distinct job titles. In smaller operations one person often overlapped several or all of these roles.</p>

            <h2>Pain Points</h2>
            <p>Along the way we discoverd some major pain points that were common themes among our users. Specifically, they disliked having to manage equipment alarms in several different ways across adva products. <strong>They wanted a simple centralized place to manage alarms despite distinctions between networks and equipment. Users also complained of the use of pop ups withing pop ups to locate equipment paramaters.</strong></p>

            <h2>Common User Experience</h2>
            <p>We found that <strong>users wanted a more unified experience across the product line so they would not have to re-learn tasks </strong>when using multiple ADVA products. These issues clearly caused problems of clarity during training and during customer service calls. I identified four areas for improvement to achieve a more balanced experience. <strong>General application structure, branding and visual styles, small interactions like buttons and selectors, and common task flows.</strong></p>
            
                <figure class="figure d-block"><a href="assets/img/adva/case-study-adva_page_5.jpg"><img class="figure-img img-fluid" src="assets/img/adva/case-study-adva_page_5.jpg" /></a>
              
            </figure>
            <p>At this stage we understood the <strong>customer jourey and problems to be solved</strong> and created a <strong>roadmap to iteratively plan and deliver our vision.</strong></p>

         <h2>Collaborative Approaches</h2>
            <p><strong>Stakeholders at every level were involved in discussions and workshops </strong>around the multiple factors that impacted our project plan. We would iteratively discuss and develop UX artifacts and discuss them with a team that was assembled to review the work product.</p>

            <p>A design was presented that seperated like functions into logical groupings, created a central workspace with multiple viewport types and placed tools and utilites in intutive locations. Good labels and icons were carefully chosen and we began to<strong> place different types of content into the application strucuture and validate the design through task analysis, developer conversations, backlog grooming, stakeholder reviews and user testing</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Insights</h2>          
     <p>Two main problems arose that took the discussion into deeper areas. <strong>Alarms and Equipment Faults being core to the success of troubleshooting, was a hot button topic </strong>and the first issue that needed to be solved. The second issue was to create <strong>a single way across all products to instantiate a new service or piece of equipment</strong>. Key findings from user research gave us detailed guidance on our decisionmaking.</p>

    <h2>Outcomes</h2>
        <p>The design activities<strong> resulted in a full and detailed front end specification for a Configurator type web interface. Also a clean, modular, responsive web design for library of reusable UI components based on modern best practices</strong>. We were able to successfully meet many challenges along the way and <strong>establish a shared vision and a shared language</strong> for the project which facilitated our timeline and brought order to the production of design assets.</p> 
        <p>Our work resulted in the creation of a Product Configurator type interface which features a large central workspace for networking tasks. We created a workflow and UI  for handling alarms and improved the alerts and notifications functions. We also established a single unified method of creating and adding network entities.</p>
        <p>We were ultimately successful as we <strong>worked to impact Key Performance Indicators and drive down technical debt</strong>. Our agile, iterative design process was completed within one year and the enhancements led to a number of improvements and optimizations including:</p>
